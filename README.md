# Healthcare Appointment Scheduling System

## Description

The Healthcare Appointment Scheduling System is a microservices-based application that provides an efficient way to manage healthcare appointments. The system will allow patients to register, view available appointments, schedule appointments with doctors, and receive notifications. Additionally, the system will enable doctors to manage their schedules and availability. The solution will include features for patient registration, doctor availability management, appointment scheduling, and notification management.

The system will be built using **Quarkus**, a Java framework for building high-performance microservices applications. **Hibernate** will be used for database management, and the system will integrate with external calendar APIs (such as Google Calendar) for scheduling.

   - **Endpoints**:
     - **POST /api/patients/register**: Registers a new patient.
     - **GET /api/patients/{id}**: Retrieves the patient’s profile.
     - **PUT /api/patients/{id}**: Updates the patient's profile.
     - **GET /api/patients/{id}/appointments**: Lists the patient’s previous appointments.
   
   - **Technologies**:
     - Quarkus RESTEasy for building REST APIs.
     - Hibernate ORM for patient data management.
     - PostgreSQL or MySQL for database storage.

### 2. **Doctor Service**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Manages doctor profiles, including their names, specialties, and availability.
     - Allows doctors to set their working hours and availability for appointments.
     - Allows doctors to view their upcoming appointments.
   
   - **Endpoints**:
     - **POST /api/doctors/register**: Registers a new doctor.
     - **GET /api/doctors/{id}**: Retrieves a doctor's profile.
     - **PUT /api/doctors/{id}**: Updates the doctor's profile.
     - **GET /api/doctors/{id}/availability**: Lists available time slots for the doctor.
     - **PUT /api/doctors/{id}/availability**: Updates the doctor’s availability.
   
   - **Technologies**:
     - Quarkus RESTEasy for building REST APIs.
     - Hibernate ORM for doctor data management.
     - PostgreSQL or MySQL for database storage.

### 3. **Appointment Service**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Manages scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of appointments between patients and doctors.
     - Verifies the availability of doctors and schedules appointments accordingly.
     - Handles cancellations and updates appointment statuses.
   
   - **Endpoints**:
     - **POST /api/appointments**: Schedules a new appointment for a patient with a doctor.
     - **GET /api/appointments/{id}**: Retrieves the details of an appointment.
     - **PUT /api/appointments/{id}**: Updates an existing appointment (reschedule).
     - **DELETE /api/appointments/{id}**: Cancels an existing appointment.
   
   - **Technologies**:
     - Quarkus RESTEasy for building REST APIs.
     - Hibernate ORM for appointment data management.
     - PostgreSQL or MySQL for database storage.
     - External Calendar API integration (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) for appointment scheduling and syncing.

### 4. **Notification Service**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Sends reminders and notifications to patients and doctors for upcoming appointments.
     - Sends appointment confirmations when scheduled.
     - Handles reminders for rescheduled or cancelled appointments.
   
   - **Endpoints**:
     - **POST /api/notifications**: Sends a notification to the patient or doctor.
     - **GET /api/notifications/{id}**: Retrieves a sent notification.
   
   - **Technologies**:
     - Use Quarkus' integration with email and SMS services for sending notifications.
     - Use third-party libraries for email (e.g., JavaMail) and SMS (e.g., Twilio).
     - Cron jobs for reminder services.

## Database Design

- **Patient Table**: Stores patient data such as name, age, address, contact info, and medical history.
- **Doctor Table**: Stores doctor information such as name, specialty, and work hours.
- **Appointment Table**: Stores information about scheduled appointments including patient ID, doctor ID, appointment time, status, and appointment type.
- **Notification Table**: Stores notification details like recipient, message, and sent status.

---

## Technologies

- **Quarkus**: High-performance Java framework for building REST APIs and microservices.
- **Hibernate ORM**: Object-relational mapping for managing database entities.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Database for storing patient, doctor, appointment, and notification data.
- **Google Calendar API**: For integrating with external calendar systems for scheduling.
- **Quarkus Extensions**:
  - `quarkus-resteasy`: For building RESTful APIs.
  - `quarkus-hibernate-orm`: For integrating with databases via Hibernate.
  - `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging`: For asynchronous communication between services.
  - `quarkus-scheduler`: For scheduling background tasks like reminders.

## Features

### 1. **Patient Registration and Management**:
   - Patients can register and update their personal and medical information.
   - Patients can view their previous appointments and medical history (if applicable).

### 2. **Doctor Scheduling**:
   - Doctors can set their working hours and availability.
   - Patients can view available slots for doctors and book appointments accordingly.

### 3. **Appointment Management**:
   - Patients can schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
   - The system verifies the availability of doctors before confirming appointments.

### 4. **Notifications**:
   - Patients and doctors receive notifications for upcoming appointments, cancellations, and changes.
   - Notification reminders are sent a day before the appointment.

## Architecture

### Microservices Interaction:
- **Patient Service** interacts with **Appointment Service** to manage patient-related appointment data.
- **Doctor Service** interacts with **Appointment Service** to manage doctor availability.
- **Notification Service** sends notifications by interacting with both **Patient Service** and **Appointment Service**.
